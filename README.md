# Favorite Repositories App

This is a simple app that allows users to browse GitHub repositories and manage their favorite repositories by adding and removing them from a list. The app is built using **React** and **TypeScript**, and the data is persisted in the browserâ€™s **localStorage**, so even if the page is refreshed, the favorite repositories remain intact.

## Features

- **Add repositories** to the favorite list from the main page.
- **View favorite repositories** on the "Favorites" page.
- **Remove repositories** from the favorite list.
- Uses **localStorage** to persist favorite repositories across page reloads.
- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a modern and type-safe development experience.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/favorite-repositories.git

2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd favorite-repositories
npm install

3. Run the app
To start the app in development mode, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

src/
components/: Contains reusable components such as Card and ShowBox to display repositories.
features/: Includes the state management logic for repositories (e.g., adding/removing favorites).
styles/: Contains CSS module files for styling components.
App.tsx: The main component of the application.
index.tsx: The entry point of the app where React is initialized.
How It Works
Adding to Favorites: When a user clicks the "star" button on a repository card, that repository is added to the list of favorite repositories. This list is stored in localStorage.

Viewing Favorites: The "Favorites" page automatically loads and displays the repositories saved in localStorage.

Removing from Favorites: A user can also remove repositories from their favorite list. When removed, the repository is deleted from localStorage, and the page is automatically updated.

Persistence: All data is persisted in the browser using localStorage, ensuring the favorite repositories are available even if the page is refreshed.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: To provide type safety and help catch potential bugs during development.
localStorage: For storing and persisting the list of favorite repositories in the browser.
CSS Modules: For scoped and modular styling of components.
